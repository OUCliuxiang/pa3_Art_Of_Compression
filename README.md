# pa3_Art_Of_Compression
The class assignment of Wang's Data Structure.

Some states should be pointed:


0, completing percentage is 11/12, function "void twoDtree::prune();" isn't completed independently.

1, May be some problems in my algorithm designing, the project will cause core dumped if you running it completely.
   
   And even if you just running the single sentence of building a tree, it will also spend 15+ seconds at Core i7 6700HQ, 
   100% using rate.
   

2, When you are using linux-kernel system( like Ubuntu, Centos, Debian... ), may be a clang/clang++ compiler is required 

   if you want  to compile the whole project at once using Makefile and however, you don't want to edit Makefile by yourself.


Finally, thanks for your contribution of improving the algorithm!
